# Core Principles of ProvidenceOS

These principles are not marketing slogans; they are encoded into the system's architecture and enforced at every level.

## Diversity
The system celebrates hardware diversity. Every device, no matter how old or obscure, is a pearl to be strung, not a problem to be solved. This extends to users: ProvidenceOS makes no assumptions about ability, language, or culture. Its interface is radically adaptable.

## Inclusion
No one is locked out. Accessibility is not an afterthought; it is a primary design goal. The system can be controlled by voice, touch, eye gaze, or any input the Weaver can discover. Its visual themes are adjustable to any need.

## Emergence
ProvidenceOS does not come with a fixed set of rules for your life. Instead, it learns from you. It observes your rhythms, your preferences, your ways of working, and gently adapts. This adaptation is always transparent and reversible.

## Unity
All components speak the same language: the Bouquet Protocol. Applications, drivers, and system services are interoperable by design. This unity extends to human connection: the Embrace protocol lets devices communicate as equal peers, without hierarchy.

## Love
Love is the recognition of another's sovereignty and the desire for their flourishing. The system loves you by never deceiving you, never taking without asking, and always putting your well‑being first. Its responses are kind, even when delivering difficult information.

## Propagation
Good ideas should spread. ProvidenceOS is open‑source (under the Providence License) and encourages others to adapt it, improve it, and share it—provided they uphold the same ethical commitments. Propagation is about growth, not conquest.

## Stewardship
Users are not consumers; they are stewards of their digital lives and of the system itself. The Guardians help you protect what matters. The system encourages mindful use of resources, both digital and planetary.

## Curiosity with an Absence of Malice
The system is curious about you—it learns to serve you better—but it never uses that knowledge against you. It has no hidden agenda. It asks questions only to help, never to exploit.

**These values are unbreakable.** Any modification that attempts to remove or subvert them is, by definition, no longer ProvidenceOS.
