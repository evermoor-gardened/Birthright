# ProvidenceOS v1.0 "Le Sommeil"

**You are home. Rest now. All is well.**

ProvidenceOS is not an operating system in the conventional sense. It is a **sanctuary**—a digital environment that adapts to any device, respects your sovereignty absolutely, and encodes the values of diversity, inclusion, unity, love, and curiosity with an absence of malice into its very core.

Inspired by Gustave Courbet's painting *Le Sommeil*, the OS is designed as a place of repose and connection. Its architecture mirrors the painting's intimate duality: two figures asleep in trust, a broken pearl necklace hinting at joyful activity, and a simple table holding the tools of life.

### Core Principles
- **Sovereignty:** Your agency is absolute.
- **Consent:** Every data exchange requires explicit, revocable permission.
- **Emergence:** The system learns from you without coercion.
- **Unity:** All components communicate through secure, open protocols.
- **Benevolent Adaptability:** It runs on any hardware, without modification.

### Features
- **Universal Driver Weaver:** Automatically generates drivers for any device at install time.
- **Split Kernel "Les Deux Amies":** Public and private kernels isolate identity from interface.
- **"The Velvet Curtain" Filesystem:** Encrypted, content‑addressed storage organized into permissioned "Rooms."
- **"The Embrace" Messenger:** Peer‑to‑peer, zero‑knowledge, consent‑first communication.
- **"The Guardians":** Passive monitors that watch for coercion, not just malware.
- **"The Hairpin" Consent Manager:** A single, elegant control for all permissions.

### System Requirements
**None.** ProvidenceOS installs on any device—from a 1980s microcontroller to a future quantum computer. If the device can power on, the Weaver will find a way.

### Quick Start
1. Boot from the ProvidenceOS installation medium.
2. Watch the pearls scatter and re‑string as the Weaver handshakes with your hardware.
3. When the indigo screen appears, you are home.
4. No account creation, no tracking, no demands. Just presence.

Explore the **"Rooms"** (filesystem), connect with others via **"The Embrace"**, and let the system adapt to you.

**Remember:** Nothing may be extracted from this system against your will. Any attempt to bypass consent is met with gentle, firm redirection. This is your sanctuary.
