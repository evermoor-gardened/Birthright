# Contributing to ProvidenceOS

We welcome contributions that align with the system's core values. Whether you are a developer, artist, writer, or user, your help is appreciated.

## Principles for Contributors
- **Respect the user's sovereignty** – never add features that diminish control.
- **Prioritize consent** – every data exchange must be opt‑in and transparent.
- **Embrace diversity** – ensure your contributions work for everyone, regardless of ability or background.
- **Act without malice** – your code should never harm, deceive, or exploit.

## How to Contribute
1. **Read the Providence License** – by contributing, you agree that your work will be licensed under it.
2. **Explore the codebase** – the core is written in a mix of Rust (for the kernel) and Python (for Essences). Documentation is in the `docs/` folder.
3. **Join the discussion** – use The Embrace to connect with other contributors. The public channel is `#providence-dev`.
4. **Submit a patch** – use the built‑in "Patch Garden" Essence to propose changes. All patches are reviewed by at least two stewards.

## What We Need
- **Driver definitions** for new hardware (add pearls to the Weaver).
- **Essence ideas** and implementations.
- **Translations** of the interface and documentation.
- **Art** for icons and themes.
- **Testing** on unusual devices.

## Code of Conduct
We have a zero‑tolerance policy for harassment, discrimination, or any behavior that makes others feel unsafe. Our community is a sanctuary too.
