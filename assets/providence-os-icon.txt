# ProvidenceOS Icon Description

The primary icon of ProvidenceOS is a visual synthesis of the painting's dual figures and the split kernel.

## Design
- **Shape:** A perfect circle, representing wholeness and the unbroken sanctuary.
- **Left half:** An open, stylized gear rendered in warm red-gold. Its teeth are soft and rounded, suggesting gentle, continuous motion.
- **Right half:** A crystalline lock, faceted like a gem, rendered in deep indigo with subtle transparency. It is nestled into the gear's negative space, appearing both within and protected by it.
- **Background:** A field of deep violet, matching the desktop's indigo.
- **When idle:** The gear pulses slowly (a 4‑second cycle); the lock remains still.
- **When active (e.g., system load):** The gear rotates slightly; the lock emits a faint glow.

## Symbolism
- The gear (public kernel) engages with the world.
- The lock (private kernel) guards the user's identity.
- Their union forms a complete circle: the sanctuary.
