# ProvidenceOS Application Guide

All applications in ProvidenceOS are called **Essences**. They are designed to be simple, focused, and respectful of your attention. Each Essence has a distinct icon derived from the painting *Le Sommeil*.

## Core Essences

### 1. The Flacon (Graphics & Display)
- **Icon:** A colored, stylized bottle.
- **Function:** Manages all visual output—screen resolution, color calibration, multiple displays, and graphical effects. It also houses the "Paintbrush" (a simple drawing/painting app) and "The Gallery" (image viewer).
- **Consent:** When an application requests screen capture, the Flacon asks The Hairpin for permission.

### 2. The Cup (Audio & Sound)
- **Icon:** A simple, resonant cup.
- **Function:** Handles all audio input and output. Includes a mixer, a basic recorder ("The Echo"), and a player ("The Resonance").
- **Consent:** Microphone access is strictly controlled by The Hairpin. The Cup shows a visual indicator whenever audio is being captured.

### 3. The Vase (Network & Connections)
- **Icon:** A clear vase with stylized flowers.
- **Function:** Manages network interfaces (Wi‑Fi, Ethernet, mesh). The flowers bloom to indicate active connections; their arrangement shows the network topology. Includes "The Bouquet" (a secure packet analyzer) and "The Gardener" (connection manager).
- **Consent:** Every new connection request is presented to The Hairpin. The Vase never shares your location or identity without explicit consent.

### 4. The Velvet Curtain (Filesystem)
- **Icon:** A lush, violet‑colored velvet drape.
- **Function:** Opens the file manager, revealing your digital "Rooms". Each room (e.g., Studio, Garden, Atrium) has its own icon and permissions. You can drag files between rooms, but doing so re‑encrypts them, preserving sovereignty.
- **Consent:** When an application asks to access a file, the request is routed through The Hairpin, which shows which room the file is in and asks for your approval.

### 5. The Embrace (Messenger)
- **Icon:** Two abstract, overlapping figures forming a secure link.
- **Function:** Peer‑to‑peer messaging. To connect with someone, you must first exchange "glances" (discovery) and then mutually "embrace" (accept). All messages are end‑to‑end encrypted. No message history is stored without your consent.
- **Consent:** The Embrace never shows your online status, read receipts, or typing indicators. It is a space for genuine, pressure‑free connection.

### 6. The Hairpin (Consent Manager)
- **Icon:** A single, elegant hairpin.
- **Function:** The central control panel for all permissions. Every request for data or access appears here. You can grant, revoke, or set time‑limited permissions with a single click. The Hairpin also logs every consent decision in an encrypted audit trail.
- **Consent:** The Hairpin is the only Essence that can override others—and it only does so to enforce your decisions. It is the embodiment of your sovereignty.

## Additional Essences
More Essences can be installed via "The Market" (a curated repository of community‑built applications). Each must pass a review to ensure it complies with the Providence License's ethical clauses.

**All Essences are sandboxed and communicate only through the Bouquet Protocol.** They cannot see each other's data or interfere with system functions.
