# ProvidenceOS Boot Sequence

When you power on a device running ProvidenceOS, you witness a carefully designed ritual that reinforces the system's values.

## Phase 0: Power On
The screen is absolute black (true zero for OLED). After a moment, a single line of text fades in, set in a soft, serif font at low opacity:

> **You are home. Rest now. All is well.**

This is the only text you will ever see during boot. It is an invitation, not an instruction.

## Phase 1: The Weaver (Hardware Handshake)
At the bottom of the screen, a string of faint, colored lights appears, scattered randomly. Each light represents a hardware component detected by the Universal Driver Weaver:
- Red → Graphics processor
- Blue → Network interface
- Gold → Somatic sensors (if present)
- Silver → Storage
- Green → Audio
- … and so on.

The lights begin to drift together, moving gently like pearls on a string. As they align, a soft, warm chime sounds—a G‑major chord, resolved and comforting. When all lights have formed a single, coherent necklace, the hardware handshake is complete.

## Phase 2: The Sleepers (Kernel Load)
The background slowly shifts to a deep, comforting indigo—the color of the velvet curtain in the painting. In the center of the screen, the paired icon fades in:
- An open gear (the Public Kernel) begins to rotate slowly, pulsing with a faint light to show the system is alive.
- A crystalline lock (the Private Kernel) rests still, nestled inside the gear. It is secure and silent.

No status bars. No percentages. Just presence.

## Phase 3: The Desktop (Sanctuary)
The dock appears at the bottom of the screen—a simple "table" holding the icons of the essential essences:
- **The Flacon** (graphics)
- **The Cup** (audio)
- **The Vase** (network)
- **The Velvet Curtain** (filesystem)
- **The Embrace** (messenger)
- **The Hairpin** (consent manager)

Each icon is rendered with soft edges and a warm glow. The network vase shows stylized flowers that have already bloomed—your device is connected to the mesh, but silent. No notifications. No demands.

The screen is a deep violet window into a room where nothing can hurt you. There is no "Start" button, no "Search" bar, no clutter. Only the tools you need, resting quietly.

**System Ready.** The sanctuary is open.
